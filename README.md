## What is AES

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is also known as Rijndael. It is established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology for doing encryption on electronic data. It has been wildly used for the decade. 

## Why using FPGA

The process of using AES to encrypt and decipher plain text contains numerous steps of matrix converting and shifting. FPGA has the advantages of executing multiple instructions at the same time, in other words, parallel computation. 

The nature of manipulating matrix is as simple as tell each element in the matrix to do specific operations. The operations can be executed one-by-on or all in parallels. Hence, using FPGA can easily map the instructions in parallel and enhanced the speed as well as the efficiency.
